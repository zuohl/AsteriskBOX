 * Redacts private filesystem locations from diagnostic text that is displayed to the user and

 *
 * The project rules require errors to stay diagnosable while never exposing configuration
 * content, key material, or private arguments. App-data and shared-storage paths are exactly
 * that, and they do reach the report: the service log records absolute paths, for instance the
 * SingBox log file that could not be cleared, and the dialog's copy action is meant to be pasted
 * into a public issue.
 *
 * The final path segment is kept. A bare filename is diagnostically useful — it says which file
 * the app was working with — while revealing nothing about the surrounding directory layout.

# AsteriskBOX

An Android sing-box GUI client.

## Telegram Channel

[Asterisk4Magisk](https://t.me/Asterisk4Magisk)

## Features

- VPN Service, TPROXY(ROOT), TUN(ROOT), eBPF(ROOT), TUN2SOCKS(ROOT), and BPF2SOCKS(ROOT) run modes
- Import and manage strict sing-box JSON configurations from QR codes, local files, or URL subscriptions
- Outbound, DNS, routing, rule-set, and resource management
- Live status, traffic, connections, proxy selection, and delay tests through the official sing-box command API
- Material 3 Compose UI

## Run Modes

### VPN Service

- Works without root permission.
- Runs sing-box in the app process through AndroidLibBoxLite and Android `VpnService`.
- The optional Hev TUN path uses `hev-socks5-tunnel`.

### TPROXY(ROOT)

- Runs the bundled sing-box binary with a TPROXY inbound.
- Uses iptables and policy routing for transparent proxy traffic.

### TUN(ROOT)

- Runs the bundled sing-box binary with the fixed TUN device `asterisk0`.
- Uses sing-box-managed `auto_route` and `auto_redirect` instead of app-managed transparent routing.
- Selected rule-set IP CIDRs are passed to `route_exclude_address_set`; domain rules do not apply.
- Exact downstream interface names can be included for hotspot and tethering traffic.

### eBPF(ROOT)

- Uses the reF1nd sing-box eBPF inbound without a TUN device or local SOCKS5 intermediary.
- Uses the TC data plane for local traffic and optional `socket_assign` for exact downstream interfaces.
- Shares TUN mode's rule-set selection and passes its IP CIDRs to `bypass_rule_set`; domain rules do not apply.
- Availability depends on device kernel, cgroup v2, and eBPF support.

### TUN2SOCKS(ROOT)

- Uses `hev-socks5-tunnel` to create the fixed TUN device `asterisk0`.
- Sends tunnel traffic to a local sing-box SOCKS5 inbound.

### BPF2SOCKS(ROOT)

- Uses eBPF and the native `bpf2socks` helper without creating a TUN device.
- Sends captured TCP and UDP traffic to a local sing-box SOCKS5 inbound.
- Requires the eBPF capability probe to pass before startup.

### asteriskd

- Watches local IPv4/IPv6 addresses and tethering interfaces, then refreshes the relevant iptables rules or BPF maps.
- Cleans up networking rules owned by the active ROOT mode when the service stops.

## Resource Files

- ROOT runtime files are stored in the app-private `files/sing-box` directory.
- The bundled reF1nd sing-box ROOT core can be replaced from Resource Management.
- Direct CIDR and custom resource files can be replaced locally or updated from configured URLs; rule sets remain part of the sing-box JSON configuration.

## Broadcast Control

Enable **Broadcast Control** in settings, then send an explicit broadcast to the receiver below. Actions use the `org.asterisk.zcc.abox.action.` prefix.

| Operation | Action suffix |
| --- | --- |
| Start proxy | `PROXY_START` |
| Stop proxy | `PROXY_STOP` |
| Toggle proxy | `PROXY_TOGGLE` |
| Update all URL subscriptions | `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` |
| Cancel broadcast subscription update | `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE_CANCEL` |
| Update all resources | `RESOURCE_UPDATE` |
| Cancel resource updates | `RESOURCE_UPDATE_CANCEL` |

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -n org.asterisk.zcc.abox/features.automation.BroadcastControlReceiver -a org.asterisk.zcc.abox.action.SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE
```

Subscription updates skip local entries; cancellation preserves completed results and scheduled update settings. Resources use the current Resource Management configuration; resource cancellation also clears its shared queue. Repeated update commands of the same kind are merged while running.

Updates run in the background without starting the proxy. Broadcast delivery does not mean the update has finished; check the `BroadcastControl` app logs for results.

## Development

Initialize submodules before building:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build with Android Studio or the Gradle wrapper:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The build resolves the configured AndroidLibBoxLite and reF1nd sing-box versions, builds the native helper submodules, and produces ABI split APKs plus a universal APK.

If Gradle cannot find the Android NDK, configure it through Android Studio, `ndk.dir` in `local.properties`, or `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`.

## WSA

```bash
appops set org.asterisk.zcc.abox ACTIVATE_VPN allow
```
